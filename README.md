# Semi-Supervised-Learning (SSL)
This repository contains the deep semi-supervised learning on CIFAR-10 dataset detecting out of distribution data points (OOD)
in unlabeled data in order to improve the performance of the SSL algorithms
The repository has the implementation of Two state of the art SSL algorithms:
Fixmatch (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07685) 
Unsupervised Data Augmentation UDA (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848)
